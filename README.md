When clicking this the extension should be downloaded to the folder where you keep your safari downloads. From there click the extension and it should install.

This is a version of the rikai (rikaichan, rikaisama, rikaikun) Japanese translation extension, which has been created for the Safari browser. When activated, simply place your cursor over Japanese words to display their dictionary definitions in a popup.
